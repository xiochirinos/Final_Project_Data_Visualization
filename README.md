# Data Visualization: Final Project

For our Final Project, I will create a Shiny App dashboard AND a Tableau dashboard.

We must build a:

Neural Network
Deep Learning Neural Network
Random Forest
SVM
AutoML model

To classify something and present the resulting data, visualizations, and metrics (accuracy, significant difference tests, etc).

The dashboard should not run the model, just present the results. The tableau dashboard should present the same data.
